Learning curve:
The Learning Curve
The ELK Stack’s learning curve is flat for what it’s meant to do. Elastic offers paid courses, but there is a lot of free material online due to the popularity of the open-source platform.

For Splunk, the learning curve is moderate in size, especially when carrying out more specialized analyzes. The company offers a trial period with extensive documentation, but the advanced Splunk educational courses are fairly expensive.
